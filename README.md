# PostIt

## What will this application do?

My application will be a forum similar to **Reddit**, made up of communities 
that each cater to a different topic or interest. Users can view posts and 
search for a specific communities.

When a new user joins, they can create an account and log in, although this 
is not necessary to view posts. Logging in allows them to:

- post content to the different communities
- like or dislike posts
- comment under posts
- save posts to their account

Currently, users can only post text-based posts, but in the future, the 
ability to post images will be added.

A logged in user can choose what content they see in their feed by 
subscribing to specific communities. Alternatively, they can visit a specific 
community and view posts that are all related to that commmunity. They can 
also sort the posts they see chronologically or by which ones have the 
most likes. 

Once logged in, a user can also view their profile and change their profile 
picture, write a short bio, or look at posts they've liked or disliked.

## Who will use it?

This project is mainly aimed at people who spend time online and wish to see 
content that is tailor made to their interests. Due to the wide variety and 
number of communities possible, anyone can find something that interests them. 

## Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me as I spend a lot of time on Reddit myself, 
and so I thought it would be interesting to see how the site is built and 
how all the different communities and users are managed. Also, I believe 
that this project is challenging enough to showcase my skills and help me 
get better at building software. I also think this project will translate 
well to the next phases of the project, as its structure allows for the 
easy addition of new features.
